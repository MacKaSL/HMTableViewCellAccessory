### About
This provides you to use a custom image as UITableViewCellAccessory. Here I have added an UIImageView as the cell accessory. Then I keep tracking which row was selected before with the variable named `previousIndexPath` and which one is selected now with the variable named `currentIndexPath`.

Enjoy :smiley:
